### Hi there 👋

I’m **Fotios Galanis**, an undergrade student at the Department of Informatics and Telecommunications of the university of Peloponnese, soon to graduate and officially become a full-fledged coder. 🎓

This “University” adventure is almost over, and I’m excited to be in the final sprint toward graduation. On my GitHub, you’ll find a collection of projects I’ve built as part of my coursework—some are half-baked, some might need a little love, and a few actually work like a charm! Feel free to explore and see the journey so far.

Know me better:

- 🔭 I’m currently looking for my first job in my career as part of my department's intership program.
- 🌱 I’m going to start working on my final project for my degree.
- 👯 I’m open to collaboration on developing code.
- 📫 How to reach me: check the attached link on my profile.
